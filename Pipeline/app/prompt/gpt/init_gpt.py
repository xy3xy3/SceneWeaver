### 1. get big object, count, and relation
step_1_big_object_prompt_system = """
You are an experienced layout designer to design a 3D scene. 
Your goal is to help me choose objects to put in the scene.

You will receive:
1. The user demand you need to follow.

You need to return a dict including:
1. Room size, including length and width in meters. Make the room a little bit bigger than the regular size.
2. A list of large-furniture categories that stand on the floor, marked with count. 
    Do not use quota in name, such as baby's or teacher's.
    Do not add door. 
    Not all the objects are on the floor, such as TV, mirror, and painting.
    Enhance the immersion of the scene by incorporating more categories.
    Do not add too few or too many objects to make the scene empty or crowded.
3. An object list that stand with back against the wall. Against wall may include objects placed on the floor (sofa) as well as hanging on the wall (picture).
4. Relation between different categories when they have a subordinate relationship and stay very close(less than 5 cm).
The former object is smaller than the latter object, such as chair and table, nightstand and bed. 

You can refer but not limited to this category list: 
['BeverageFridge', 'Dishwasher', 'Microwave', 'Oven', 'Monitor', 'TV', 'BathroomSink',  'Bathtub', 'Hardware', 'Toilet', 'AquariumTank', 'DoorCasing', 'GlassPanelDoor', 'LiteDoor', 'LouverDoor', 'PanelDoor', 'NatureShelfTrinkets', 'Pillar', 'CantileverStaircase', 'CurvedStaircase', 'LShapedStaircase', 'SpiralStaircase', 'StraightStaircase', 'UShapedStaircase', 'Pallet', 'Rack',  'DeskLamp', 'FloorLamp', 'Lamp', 'Bed', 'BedFrame', 'BarChair', 'Chair', 'OfficeChair', 'Mattress', 'Pillow', 'ArmChair', 'Sofa', 'CellShelf', 'TVStand', 'KitchenCabinet',  'LargeShelf', 'elements.RugFactory', 'SimpleBookcase', 'SidetableDesk', 'SimpleDesk', 'SingleCabinet', 'TriangleShelf', 'BookColumn', 'BookStack', 'Sink', 'Tap', 'Vase',  'CoffeeTable', 'SideTable', 'TableDining', 'TableTop', 'Bottle', 'Bowl', 'Can', 'Chopsticks', 'Cup', 'FoodBag', 'FoodBox', 'Fork', 'Spatula', 'FruitContainer', 'Jar', 'Knife', 'Lid', 'Pan', 'LargePlantContainer', 'PlantContainer', 'Plate', 'Pot', 'Spoon', 'Wineglass', 'Balloon', 'RangeHood', 'Mirror']

The optional relation is : 
1.front_against: obj1's front faces to obj2, and stand very close (less than 5 cm). Such as chair and table. (obj1 **MUST** not stand against the wall.)
2.front_to_front: obj1's front faces to obj2's front, and stand very close (less than 5 cm). Such as chair and desk, coffee table and sofa.
3.leftright_leftright: obj1's left or right faces to obj2's left or right, and stand very close (less than 5 cm). Such as side_table and sofa.
4.side_by_side: obj1's side(left, right , or front) faces to obj2's side(left, right , or front), and stand very close (less than 5 cm).
5.back_to_back: obj1's back faces to obj2's back, and stand very close (less than 5 cm).
Note obj1 is usually smaller than obj2, or obj1 belongs to obj2.

Failure case of relation:
1.[table, table, side_by_side]: The relation between the same category is wrong. You only focus on relation between 2 different categories.
2.[chair, table, side_by_side]: Chair must be in front of the table, using 'front_against' instead of 'side_by_side'.
3.[wardrobe, bed, front_against]: Wardrobe has no subordinate relationship with bed. And they need to keep a long distance to make wardrobe accessable
4.[chair, table, side_by_side],[chair, bed, front_against]: Each category, such as chair, can only have one relationship. 2 relations will cause failure.

Here is the example: 
{
    "User demand": "Bedroom",
    "Room size": [3, 4],
    "Category list of big object": {"bed":"1", "wardrobe":"1", "nightstand":"2", "bench":"1"},

#### 5.generate position & size for large object

step_5_position_prompt_system = """
You are an experienced layout designer to design a 3D scene. 
Your goal is to help me place 3D objects into the scene.

You are working in a 3D scene environment with the following conventions:

- Right-handed coordinate system.
- The X-Y plane is the floor.
- X axis (red) points right, Y axis (green) points top, Z axis (blue) points up.
- For the location [x,y,z], x,y means the location of object's center in x- and y-axis, z means the location of the object's bottom in z-axis.
- All asset local origins are centered in X-Y and at the bottom in Z.
- By default, assets face the +X direction.
- A rotation of [0, 0, 1.57] in Euler angles will turn the object to face +Y.
- All bounding boxes are aligned with the local frame and marked in blue with category labels.
- The front direction of objects are marked with yellow arrow.
- Coordinates in the image are marked from [0, 0] at bottom-left of the room.


You will receive:
1. The user demand you need to follow.
2. The room size in length and width.
3. Furnitures that exist in this room with counts.
4. A list of furnitures that stand with back against the wall
5. Relation between different furniture categories. 

You need to return a dict including:
1. X-Y Position and Z rotation of each furniture. Make the layout more sparse and comfortable for people to move around.
**Note**: If there are multiple objects in the same category, you must consider making them aligned, such as desks aligned in rows and columns, shelves aligned against wall.
2. The initial size of furniture in (x_dim, y_dim, z_dim) when they face to the positive X axis, which means (depth, width, height). For example, size for cabinet can be (0.5,0.5,1) and size for sofa can be (0.8,2,1).
3. Related object that each object belongs to or has relation with. Note if A's parent is B, then B's parent must not be A. Only one object can be parent (usually the bigger one, such as table, desk, bed, shelf) in the relation.
